# Global-Evidence-on-Inflation-Instability-and-Shock-Duration
Countries experience inflation instability in different ways. Some face frequent small shocks, others rare but severe spikes, and some suffer both. Solutions include strengthening monetary policy, improving supply chains, diversifying economies, and building resilience to external shocks.
# Problem Statement
Countries with similar inflation levels often experience fundamentally different inflation dynamics. The absence of cross-country comparative analysis prevents a clear understanding of why some economies remain stable while others face persistent volatility.
